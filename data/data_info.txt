- "images/" is populated through "data_gather.py" which gathers images
            If possible, it is recommended to sort through data collected by hand discarding an image if:
                1) image is in 2d
                2) image does not include landscape, city, or language
                3) image is modified (filters, etc.)
- "images_sorted_by_country/" is populated through "sort_images_by_country.py"
    - These images are used to train classification model and regression models per country

- *Tip* -> All Downloaded Image Data can be Mapped with "visualize_data.py"
- *Tip* -> All Sorted Image Data can be visualized for class imbalance with "visualize_class_imbalance.py" -> 
            This is corrected for in large part by weighted classes in "train_country_classifier.py" -> large batch sizes preferred
